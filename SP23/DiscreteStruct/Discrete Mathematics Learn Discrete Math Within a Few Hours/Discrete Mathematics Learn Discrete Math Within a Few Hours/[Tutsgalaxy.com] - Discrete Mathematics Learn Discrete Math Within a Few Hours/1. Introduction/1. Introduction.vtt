Hello my name is Luke and I will be your instructor throughout this girls and this girl.

00:07.650 --> 00:11.850
You are a master discrete math within a few hours.

00:11.850 --> 00:16.150
The topics that are covered in this girls are logic.

00:16.200 --> 00:22.600
I talk about logical statements logical connectives and logical formula us.

00:22.650 --> 00:25.510
Then we move on to sets.

00:25.530 --> 00:34.230
I explain what is said what operations can we do with SATs and we will take a look at relations and

00:34.230 --> 00:35.460
functions.

00:35.460 --> 00:45.390
Then we move on to combinatorics where I explain permutation variations and combinations and we finish

00:45.540 --> 00:47.150
with graphs.

00:47.160 --> 00:55.920
I explain what is graph and also I show you how dexterous shortest path algorithm works inside the curves

00:55.980 --> 01:03.750
are plenty of exercises on which you can practice and if you get stuck or don't understand something

01:04.110 --> 01:06.580
you can always reach out to me.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.560
Mostly I respond to questions within a day and that is pretty much it.

01:12.570 --> 01:15.780
Thanks for your time and I will see you in the curves.
