00:00.390 --> 00:08.820
Logical formula it's something that is made up from statements that means from others say Z and from

00:08.830 --> 00:10.280
logical connects.

00:10.500 --> 00:10.990
Yeah.

00:11.070 --> 00:13.070
And also prentices.

00:13.140 --> 00:19.670
So for example logical formula can look like this negation ne implies B.

00:19.680 --> 00:25.510
It's equivalent with A or B and every formula is either tautology.

00:25.710 --> 00:34.020
That means no matter what logical value A and B have for every logical value the formula will result

00:34.110 --> 00:43.560
in to true or former can be satisfiable and formalized satisfiable if it is true under at least one

00:43.650 --> 00:46.910
interpretation of A and B.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.650
And last one is a contradiction.

00:49.980 --> 00:56.290
And that means formalize false no matter what logic a value A and B have.

00:56.550 --> 01:02.130
So how do you find out what kind of formula we have here.

01:02.180 --> 01:03.870
We all use table.

01:03.990 --> 01:12.060
So the arguments are A and B and we will consider every possible scenario.

01:12.060 --> 01:18.290
Now let's look at our formula and you can kind of split it into smaller parts.

01:18.330 --> 01:18.950
Right.

01:19.230 --> 01:24.660
Compute these smaller parts and then put the result together.

01:24.720 --> 01:33.670
So on the right side we have a or b and on their side we have negation they implies B.

01:33.720 --> 01:37.500
So let's compute leftside first.

01:37.980 --> 01:48.110
I recommend compute negation a first and then compute implication of negation A and B.

01:48.180 --> 01:53.320
So let's do this as you already know negation flips that.

01:53.520 --> 01:59.210
So where A is zero negation of A will be won.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.340
And where is one negation of they will be zero.

02:04.140 --> 02:05.480
Like this.

02:05.520 --> 02:11.260
So now let's compute implication of negation A and B.

02:11.760 --> 02:22.890
And we know that implication results into false only a first operand is true and second one is false.

02:22.890 --> 02:30.600
So if we look at our table we can see that this line will be false right.

02:30.810 --> 02:39.740
Because negation of AA is true and B is false by all the other lines will be true.

02:40.140 --> 02:44.300
So we have compute our left side.

02:44.310 --> 02:47.370
Now let's compute the right side.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.980
This one is easier.

02:48.990 --> 02:49.920
We just do.

02:50.220 --> 02:52.380
Or over a and b.

02:52.560 --> 02:58.270
So Or is false when both operands are false.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.530
And that happens only in the first row.

03:02.270 --> 03:04.740
All the other rows will be true.

03:04.940 --> 03:06.250
So now.

03:06.300 --> 03:11.110
So now let's put the left side and right side together.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.050
We have equivalence between them.

03:14.120 --> 03:23.480
So that means that you of leftside is same as right side we get true otherwise false.

03:23.600 --> 03:32.870
That if you look at this table you can see that negation ne implies B is the same as say or B.

03:32.870 --> 03:36.560
So this formula will be true no matter what.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.450
A and B are.

03:38.750 --> 03:42.770
So this formula is a tautology.

03:42.770 --> 03:49.100
Now I want you to try this on your own with these two formulas.

03:49.100 --> 03:53.920
The first one has only negation in front of or.

03:54.110 --> 04:01.220
So that means you do negation of the result of this or operation.

04:01.220 --> 04:04.670
And this formula should be contradiction.

04:04.700 --> 04:11.790
That means falles everywhere and the second one looks like this.

04:11.800 --> 04:17.930
So instead of or is send and this one should be satisfied.

04:18.280 --> 04:21.510
And it should be 1 0 0 1.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.510
So try this on your own.

04:23.530 --> 04:30.430
And if you get stuck just posed the question now from this first example.

04:30.460 --> 04:33.670
You might notice that it tells us something.

04:33.730 --> 04:40.710
This formula is tautology and that means left side is equal to right side.

04:41.080 --> 04:47.680
And that means we can use negation and implication instead of our.

04:47.720 --> 04:57.020
And now I'm going to tell you a secret we can use negation and implication instead of and two and instead

04:57.020 --> 04:58.840
of Lachlan's two.

04:58.850 --> 05:09.650
So in order for us to write any formula we need only negation and implication as you saw in the first

05:09.650 --> 05:10.600
example.

05:10.640 --> 05:15.800
Negation A implies B is equivalent to A or B.

05:17.010 --> 05:23.440
Negation ave implies negation of B is equivalent to A and B.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.470
And equivalence is a bit complicated.

05:27.540 --> 05:38.670
It is negation of they implies B that implies negation of B implies they and that is the same as if

05:38.670 --> 05:41.910
you write A is equivalent to B.

05:42.150 --> 05:46.280
You can't try to prove it like I did in the first example.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.870
It should always be tautology.

05:49.290 --> 05:49.790
OK.

05:49.860 --> 05:52.750
That is pretty much it for this lecture.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.320
If you have any questions feel free to ask.

05:56.340 --> 06:01.860
I suggest you play with these and if you get stuck feel free to post the question.

06:01.860 --> 06:05.380
I will be there to help you and I will see you next time.
