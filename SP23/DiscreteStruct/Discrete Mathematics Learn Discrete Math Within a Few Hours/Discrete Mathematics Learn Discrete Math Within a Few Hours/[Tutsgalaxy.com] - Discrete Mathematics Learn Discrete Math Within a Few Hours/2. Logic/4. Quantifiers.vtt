00:00.530 --> 00:09.150
We have to quantifications first one looks like this and it says that for every X is true.

00:09.170 --> 00:15.130
That's something where instead of something you have some statement obviously.

00:15.260 --> 00:18.550
And the second one looks like this.

00:18.770 --> 00:24.510
And it says that there exists a four which is true.

00:24.530 --> 00:25.960
That's something.

00:26.030 --> 00:33.790
So if you think about it the first quantified gator is basically kind of a tautology quantification

00:33.890 --> 00:37.050
or for every x must be true.

00:37.280 --> 00:46.040
And the second one is basically set this wildfowl quantification or that means for at least one is true.

00:46.430 --> 00:50.650
So now let's take a look at some examples.

00:50.660 --> 00:56.090
First one says that for every x that is real number.

00:56.150 --> 01:06.930
So these are represent a set of all real numbers like for example 0 5 minus 2 and so on.

01:07.130 --> 01:14.180
And this euro kind of side says that X is from this set.

01:14.180 --> 01:23.390
So no matter what number we pick from our For every number should be true that this number to the power

01:23.390 --> 01:26.680
of two is greater than zero.

01:27.630 --> 01:36.000
So feel free to think about it but keep in mind that it must be true for every number that you can think

01:36.060 --> 01:36.800
of.

01:36.900 --> 01:45.510
And if you really think about it and big zero sacks you will find out that 0 to the power of two is

01:45.510 --> 01:46.590
still zero.

01:46.860 --> 01:50.820
And that means this is not true for every x.

01:50.820 --> 01:54.830
So overall this statement is false.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.280
Let's do another one.

01:56.640 --> 02:08.500
This one says that there exists x that is from real numbers and it is greater than 1000 and there is

02:08.550 --> 02:12.980
because R represents all the numbers in our world.

02:13.230 --> 02:19.350
So if you pick for example billion for x you will get true.

02:19.380 --> 02:26.420
And since this quantifier says that it is true for at least one we are done.

02:26.460 --> 02:28.870
And this statement is true.

02:29.250 --> 02:37.700
And last one says that for every x It's true that there exist that is smaller.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.810
And boy these numbers are from our.

02:41.880 --> 02:50.550
So if you think about it if you pick any number in this world you can always find a smaller one.

02:50.880 --> 03:00.360
And if you think about it no matter what X you pick if you choose to be equal to x minus one it will

03:00.360 --> 03:02.460
always be smaller then x.

03:02.460 --> 03:03.340
Right.

03:03.740 --> 03:04.220
OK.

03:04.260 --> 03:07.320
That is pretty much it for this lecture.

03:07.320 --> 03:14.280
Feel free to ask if you don't understand something we will use these cuenta fires later on.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.550
And with that being said I will see you next time.
