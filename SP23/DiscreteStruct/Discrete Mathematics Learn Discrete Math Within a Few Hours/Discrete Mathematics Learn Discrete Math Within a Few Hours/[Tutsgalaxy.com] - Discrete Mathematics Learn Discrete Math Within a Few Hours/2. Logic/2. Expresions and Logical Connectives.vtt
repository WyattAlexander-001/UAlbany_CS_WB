00:00.720 --> 00:09.060
Let's start with expressions more precisely logical expressions so logical expression is just something

00:09.330 --> 00:11.580
that can be true or false.

00:11.580 --> 00:15.600
So for example 5 is smaller than free.

00:15.810 --> 00:23.120
You can obviously see that it is complete nonsense but it is still a logical statement that is false

00:23.130 --> 00:26.730
right and that her expression could be for example.

00:26.760 --> 00:33.100
My father is 50 years old because it can either be true or false.

00:33.150 --> 00:36.210
There is nothing between no third option.

00:36.210 --> 00:36.900
Right.

00:37.020 --> 00:47.090
And since we care about the form and not content we will call all statements by letters from A to Z.

00:47.190 --> 00:54.960
And since then our natural language we are talking using these statements and connectives.

00:55.050 --> 01:04.370
So in order for us to be able to transfer a sentence into logic a formula we need a logical connectives.

01:04.560 --> 01:08.440
And thankfully there is only five of them.

01:08.490 --> 01:12.270
So the first one is negation.

01:12.450 --> 01:13.640
It looks like this.

01:13.680 --> 01:23.460
And it represents not in our spoken word logic a formula that looks like this negation of A where A

01:23.460 --> 01:31.230
represents Stakman that since instead of a we can put any statement remember we care about the form

01:31.860 --> 01:37.860
not about content bad we know that it can either be true or false.

01:38.010 --> 01:44.140
And since we are lazy we represent true by one and false by zero.

01:44.340 --> 01:56.460
So if A is true negation of true is false and if A is zero negation of false is true.

01:56.910 --> 01:59.720
So that means 1.

01:59.730 --> 02:05.400
So one negation does it kind of flips the logical value in simple words.

02:05.400 --> 02:16.110
OK the next one is or and if you think about it when you talk you use or all the time and logical formula

02:16.200 --> 02:17.990
it looks like we.

02:18.030 --> 02:22.010
So A or B looks like this.

02:22.010 --> 02:25.290
If A and B is zero.

02:25.500 --> 02:34.440
This logical formula will result in two thoughts that if A is false and B is true this formula will

02:34.440 --> 02:35.660
result in two.

02:35.650 --> 02:40.490
True if A is true and B is false we get true.

02:40.620 --> 02:44.260
And if A is true and B is true we get true.

02:44.640 --> 02:50.340
So Or is true if at least one of its operand is true.

02:50.760 --> 02:57.870
And if you think about it it kind of makes sense and it corresponds with or in our natural language

02:58.410 --> 03:03.540
and since we have or we also have an and looks like this.

03:03.660 --> 03:07.220
So it is kind of a without the line in middle.

03:07.410 --> 03:10.350
So A and B looks like this.

03:10.410 --> 03:19.260
And when A is false and B is false A and B will result in two thoughts.

03:19.260 --> 03:24.300
When A is false and B is true we get falls again.

03:24.300 --> 03:28.020
When A is true and B is false.

03:28.020 --> 03:35.030
We get still false that when A is true and B is true we get true.

03:35.310 --> 03:42.600
So in order for and to be true we need a and b to be both true.

03:42.600 --> 03:47.990
You can think of it as multiplication one times one gives you one.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.680
OK let's look at another one.

03:50.940 --> 03:54.960
The next one is pretty simple and kind of straightforward.

03:55.140 --> 04:00.840
It is equivalence sometimes known as logical biconditional.

04:01.170 --> 04:05.190
And it is true if operands have same value.

04:05.190 --> 04:12.060
So if they and B is false we get true because they are equal.

04:12.150 --> 04:15.900
If A and B is true we get true.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.800
Otherwise we get false.

04:18.030 --> 04:22.630
So you can think about it as an equal sign.

04:22.650 --> 04:24.390
Zero is equal to zero.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.410
But zero is not equal to 1.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.800
Right.

04:27.960 --> 04:35.020
The last one is implication and I kind of show you implication in previous lecture.

04:35.020 --> 04:39.120
But I want to talk more about its purpose in this one.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.990
So it looks like this as you already know.

04:43.110 --> 04:49.740
And if a is false then no matter what B is we get true.

04:49.980 --> 04:56.110
But if a is true and B is false we get false.

04:56.340 --> 05:07.030
And if a is true and B is also true we get true so this one is not consistent and you might thing that

05:07.030 --> 05:08.140
is kind of weird.

05:08.230 --> 05:15.970
And I think the best way for you to understand implication is through this sentence if it's raining

05:16.090 --> 05:17.490
than it's cloudy.

05:17.620 --> 05:25.510
So a is raining and B it's cloudy and let's go through all the logical values.

05:25.630 --> 05:26.730
They can have.

05:26.980 --> 05:32.290
So first one is that a is false and B is also false.

05:32.380 --> 05:36.940
So if it's not raining then it's not cloudy.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.840
And that is OK.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.050
That makes sense right.

05:40.210 --> 05:41.970
And it is true.

05:42.400 --> 05:50.440
Next one says that if it's not raining then it's cloudy and that also makes sense right.

05:50.450 --> 05:55.850
You can have clouds without rain but now it gets interesting.

05:56.110 --> 06:02.830
If it is raining then it is not cloudy and this doesn't make sense right.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.760
Because in order to rain you need clouds.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.850
So this is false.

06:09.430 --> 06:15.710
And last one says if it is raining it is cloudy and doesn't make sense so it is true.

06:16.070 --> 06:16.620
OK.

06:16.650 --> 06:19.500
That is pretty much it for this lecture.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.990
We'll play more with these in next lectures.

06:23.200 --> 06:28.490
So if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will see you next time.
