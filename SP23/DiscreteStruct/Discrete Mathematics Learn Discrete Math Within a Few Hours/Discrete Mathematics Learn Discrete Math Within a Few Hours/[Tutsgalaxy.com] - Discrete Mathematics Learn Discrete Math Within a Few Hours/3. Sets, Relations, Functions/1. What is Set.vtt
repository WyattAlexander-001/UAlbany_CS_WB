Ortez said said it's a collection of some data you can think about it as a box containing some object.

00:10.750 --> 00:24.040
So for example if I have box that contains numbers 8 4 6 and 0 in mathematic the boxes said and 8 4

00:24.160 --> 00:28.160
6 and 0 are elements of this set.

00:28.450 --> 00:31.110
And we usually use this notation.

00:31.210 --> 00:41.650
So we use braces these braces define set and inside these braces we write our elements and we separate

00:41.650 --> 00:47.850
them with comma and we can also call every set by its name.

00:47.860 --> 00:50.560
So for example does this set A.

00:50.620 --> 00:55.850
And it contains 8 4 6 and 0.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.720
Another thing I need to mention is that sets are unordered.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.070
What that means.

01:02.410 --> 01:09.550
Well if you take a box and fill it with numbers it doesn't matter what number is most right.

01:09.550 --> 01:14.320
All we care about is if the number is in the box.

01:14.320 --> 01:27.640
So for example if I create set B that contains 0 8 4 and 6 it is the same as set a Y because every element

01:27.640 --> 01:35.780
that has been set B is also in set A and every element that is inside a is also in B.

01:35.830 --> 01:40.320
So it doesn't matter in what order the elements are.

01:40.360 --> 01:45.130
All we care about is whether the elements are in set.

01:45.340 --> 01:50.390
Another important thing is that we don't have repeating elements.

01:50.590 --> 02:02.830
So for example if I define set C that contains 8 4 6 0 and 8 it is still equal to set a y.

02:02.860 --> 02:11.200
Once again we care only about whether the element is in set and we don't care how many times it isn't

02:11.200 --> 02:12.160
said.

02:12.550 --> 02:13.240
OK.

02:13.370 --> 02:22.990
Now let's talk about the ways to define set we can do it simply by writing out all the elements inside

02:22.990 --> 02:24.150
braces.

02:24.160 --> 02:28.510
But sometimes we have an infinite set.

02:28.510 --> 02:33.960
And obviously you can't just write all the elements inside braces.

02:34.150 --> 02:40.480
So we define these sets using their characteristic property.

02:40.600 --> 02:48.760
And what do I mean by that we can say that this set will contain all the prime numbers.

02:48.760 --> 02:57.160
For those of you who don't know what prime number is it is just number that we can divide only by 1

02:57.460 --> 02:58.750
and itself.

02:58.870 --> 03:03.660
In this case you can use natural language to describe this.

03:03.670 --> 03:05.270
You can write it like this.

03:05.290 --> 03:13.260
So braces and inside X from an where and represents that of natural numbers.

03:13.420 --> 03:24.460
So numbers like 1 2 free and so on to infinity for example two point five zero or minus five is not

03:24.460 --> 03:26.000
in the set.

03:26.020 --> 03:33.150
There are only positive integers and then there is this kind of separator.

03:33.250 --> 03:38.700
And here we define what this X should look like.

03:38.890 --> 03:42.260
If we use natural language we can just write.

03:42.370 --> 03:45.710
X is prime number and we are done.

03:45.730 --> 03:50.350
But sometimes natural language can be misleading.

03:50.410 --> 03:57.570
So some mathematical description is often used for example like this.

03:57.730 --> 04:08.770
So this set is containing every x that is from natural numbers and also is true that for every I that

04:08.770 --> 04:20.640
is from natural numbers if X modulo Y is equal to zero then I's equal one or equal to x.

04:20.710 --> 04:24.880
So that is how mathematic definition could look like.

04:24.880 --> 04:36.490
So something's up said is a collection of data objects inside of a set are called elements to define

04:36.490 --> 04:45.580
said we as racists and inside them we write all the elements or we write characteristic property.

04:45.700 --> 04:53.790
Also it doesn't matter what order the elements are and how many times they are in set.

04:54.100 --> 05:02.470
Also set can contain numbers but it can also contain string or anything else.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.230
So that is all there is to it.

05:05.300 --> 05:09.690
If you have any questions just ask and I will see you next time.
