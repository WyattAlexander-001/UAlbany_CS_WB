Waters function well function is something that assigns value to other values but in general function

00:09.730 --> 00:21.730
is just a relation between A and B which for every x may assigns exactly one from B and that x and y

00:21.940 --> 00:27.760
are in this relation that is kind of mathematical definition of function.

00:27.880 --> 00:33.410
But let's look at more kind of user friendly definition here.

00:33.460 --> 00:42.250
I have function neth that x and so all the natural numbers and it returns returns some are so real number

00:42.730 --> 00:47.800
and it is defined as is equal to x plus 1.

00:47.800 --> 00:55.150
So it's kind of what this function returns and x is what this function takes.

00:55.150 --> 00:58.130
So in general you get this equation.

00:58.310 --> 01:01.480
Brentham sees x is equal to Y.

01:01.510 --> 01:06.240
So for example f of free is equal to 4 y.

01:06.430 --> 01:14.160
Well you are using this equation to compute the returned value and you want to compute.

01:14.440 --> 01:18.000
And X is passed into this function.

01:18.250 --> 01:25.190
And since I call this function with 3 I will be equal to free plus 1 so 4.

01:25.300 --> 01:30.190
And if you call this function with 6 you will get 7.

01:30.190 --> 01:38.280
So notice that for every x you pass into this function returns us exactly one value.

01:38.560 --> 01:48.470
And now if you look at definition it says that for every x from I there is exactly 1 I from B.

01:48.610 --> 01:51.840
And that's exactly what is happening in here.

01:52.150 --> 01:57.110
We are passing 1 x and we are getting exactly 1.

01:57.370 --> 02:00.300
So something like this cannot happen.

02:00.340 --> 02:02.220
We can get to.

02:02.380 --> 02:07.070
As a result of one X also we can get no I.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.200
As a result of one next.

02:09.280 --> 02:18.310
So for example if I have a function g that takes a real number and returns as either a real number and

02:18.370 --> 02:27.570
it is defined as xy equals 1 divided by x that is is not a function here.

02:27.590 --> 02:33.870
You can pause the video and try to figure out why the problem is that there is not.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.680
I for every x.

02:35.720 --> 02:44.690
So for example if I call this function with two i get 1 1/2 and that is OK if I call it with minus two

02:45.230 --> 02:46.130
and minus.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.170
And that is also fine.

02:48.350 --> 02:53.810
But when I call this function with zero I get nothing.

02:53.810 --> 02:54.530
Why.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.900
Because you cannot divide by zero.

02:58.070 --> 03:05.850
And if we look at the definition it says that for every x there must be exactly 1.

03:06.050 --> 03:10.900
And here is not so this is not a function.

03:10.910 --> 03:16.320
Now let's make even more user friendly definition here.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.590
I will define sets like this.

03:18.590 --> 03:21.070
So this is set A.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.000
And this is said B.

03:23.210 --> 03:33.530
And in set A We have some elements let's say 1 2 3 4 and 5 and instead B we have other elements like

03:33.530 --> 03:34.950
a b c d.

03:35.120 --> 03:43.520
So now if we have a function from A to B This function will kind of assign to every element from May

03:43.850 --> 03:45.910
some other element in B.

03:45.920 --> 03:46.710
Right.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.710
So for example it can assign to a 1.

03:50.920 --> 03:58.580
But the important thing is that this function needs to assign some value to every element for math.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.580
So for example like this.

04:01.580 --> 04:10.110
Notice that there is exactly one arrow from every element from set A to some element from said B.

04:10.340 --> 04:12.380
So that is correct.

04:12.770 --> 04:22.820
But if I have two arrows from some element in NE to some other element and B it is not a function because

04:22.970 --> 04:26.980
B is are I and in a is R x.

04:27.090 --> 04:36.190
So for one next we get two possible eyes and that can happen.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.760
So this is not a function.

04:38.930 --> 04:43.650
And also every element has to point to some element in B.

04:43.670 --> 04:53.440
So if I get rid of this arrow f is not a function because it doesn't return nigh for every x.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.720
I think this is pretty clear.

04:55.730 --> 05:02.840
So let's look at some properties function can be injective and what that means.

05:03.020 --> 05:08.140
Well there is no two arrows pointing to some element in B.

05:08.240 --> 05:11.110
There is always one zero or none.

05:11.330 --> 05:21.320
So for example function that is defined as xy is equal to x squared is not injective.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.400
Why.

05:22.400 --> 05:29.180
Because for example free and minus free will both result in 2 9.

05:29.420 --> 05:33.750
So they are kind of two pointers pointing to night.

05:33.980 --> 05:40.550
But for example function is equal to x plus two is injective.

05:40.550 --> 05:41.530
Why.

05:41.630 --> 05:47.840
Because there are no two access that will result into say my.

05:47.900 --> 05:56.750
So if I write this definition kind of mathematically function a to b is injective went for every x 1

05:56.780 --> 05:58.980
and x 2 from a.

05:59.390 --> 06:06.390
So if x 1 is not equal to x to the return value is also not equal.

06:06.500 --> 06:11.600
So f of x 1 is not equal to 4 x 2.

06:11.600 --> 06:18.100
I hope this makes sense that a property is surjection and all that means well.

06:18.110 --> 06:21.830
Function from A to B is surgical.

06:22.040 --> 06:25.780
If there is no to every element in B.

06:25.850 --> 06:31.930
So for every i from B existe X from a.

06:32.180 --> 06:38.560
That and it is true that f of this X will result in two.

06:38.960 --> 06:50.960
So for example the function from A to B where A contains 1 2 and B and B contains A and B is surjective

06:51.430 --> 07:00.180
y well to every element in B leads and narrow and it is OK that to B leads to arrows.

07:00.200 --> 07:07.690
The important thing is that there is at least one arrow to every element in the bad.

07:07.700 --> 07:13.050
If for example a one would be in the relation with B instead of a.

07:13.400 --> 07:20.180
This function would not be surjective because there is no arrow that leads us to a.

07:20.510 --> 07:23.290
I think this makes sense also.

07:23.290 --> 07:32.400
Function can be bijective and what that means well if function is bijective it is injective and surjective.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.720
So this is pretty easy.

07:34.920 --> 07:40.360
I hope this makes sense if you have any questions just ask and I will see you next time.
