00:00.990 --> 00:05.470
In previous lecture we find what is that.

00:05.620 --> 00:10.770
And in this lecture I will show you what can we do with SATs.

00:10.900 --> 00:15.920
In other words what operations we can do with sets.

00:16.180 --> 00:25.560
First operation is called subset and it is similar to smaller than or equal to sign that this one is

00:25.570 --> 00:38.380
more kind around and a subset of B when B contains every element that is then A and it can also contain

00:38.470 --> 00:41.490
other elements that are not in play.

00:41.590 --> 00:43.030
And that is OK.

00:43.030 --> 00:48.650
Important does that B contains every element from May.

00:48.670 --> 00:51.640
So here are a few examples.

00:51.640 --> 01:01.000
First one is correct because one is in set B four is instead B and nine is said B.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.910
So it is true and it doesn't matter in what order they are.

01:06.910 --> 01:16.900
Important thing is that B contains every element from a second example is false because in a we have

01:17.000 --> 01:25.330
a right but in B we do not have it and it is not enough to have some elements.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.710
There must be every element.

01:28.240 --> 01:33.310
And also note is this if a is not a subset of B.

01:33.550 --> 01:37.430
We use this notation to describe this relation.

01:37.830 --> 01:38.530
OK.

01:38.740 --> 01:44.170
And the last example the sets are equal as you can see.

01:44.320 --> 01:50.380
So it is also true that B contains every element from May.

01:50.380 --> 01:55.080
In other words a subset of B.

01:55.080 --> 02:05.700
Now I want you to pause the video and think about when a and b are equal and you subset operation to

02:05.700 --> 02:07.960
describe this relationship.

02:08.370 --> 02:16.750
OK so we know that in order for a to be the same as B we need to have every element for may be.

02:16.980 --> 02:21.190
But we also need to have every element from B.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.160
Right.

02:22.350 --> 02:27.920
So now it is pretty simple to describe it using subsets operation.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.680
Right.

02:28.860 --> 02:36.300
A and B are equal if A is subset of B and B is a subset of J.

02:36.450 --> 02:40.350
And really if you think about it it makes sense.

02:40.560 --> 02:53.130
For example if a contains four and six and B contains 0 4 and 6 a subset of B because four and six R&amp;B

02:53.870 --> 02:58.530
about B in a subset of they because 0 is not in they.

02:58.830 --> 03:02.970
So a is not equal to be.

03:02.970 --> 03:10.580
Another important thing is cardinality of said and it is just the number of elements in set.

03:10.710 --> 03:14.750
We use this notation to describe cardinality.

03:14.830 --> 03:25.390
So if we have set B containing red blue green and yellow the cardinality of this set B is 4 because

03:25.420 --> 03:27.420
B contains four elements.

03:27.430 --> 03:28.960
Very simple right.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.010
That also sets can have no elements.

03:33.010 --> 03:35.400
Think of it as empty box.

03:35.530 --> 03:45.680
These are defined by this GRASSET zero and it just means empty box empty braces set that have no elements

03:46.100 --> 03:50.160
and cardinality of the set is obviously zero.

03:50.180 --> 03:54.310
Also some sets have cardinality equal to infin..

03:54.350 --> 03:54.990
Why.

03:55.190 --> 03:58.930
Well they have infinite number of elements.

03:59.120 --> 04:08.100
For example if I take all numbers from one to infinity and put them into one said they said will contain

04:08.120 --> 04:13.900
1 2 3 4 5 6 6 billions and so on and so on.

04:14.060 --> 04:22.870
And it will never stop because we are going to infinity and infinity just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

04:22.910 --> 04:25.790
So it's something like our universe.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.930
It expands all the time.

04:28.130 --> 04:31.300
So it is infinite it is bad.

04:31.490 --> 04:34.750
I will talk more about this in next lectures.

04:34.820 --> 04:38.570
Let's look at another basic operation.

04:38.570 --> 04:48.310
First one is union and we use this operation to kind of put together two sets and two on to describe

04:48.320 --> 04:49.100
Union.

04:49.130 --> 04:51.310
We use this kind of use side.

04:51.530 --> 05:03.100
So for example if I do a union of A and B and C will be all elements from A and all elements from B.

05:03.110 --> 05:15.210
So if A is containing 1 and 2 and B is containing 2 and free union of A and B will be 1 2 FREE.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.060
Why isn't that 1 2 2 free.

05:18.350 --> 05:21.920
Well we didn't not write repeating elements right.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.580
I mentioned this in previous lecture.

05:24.620 --> 05:28.410
So let's take a look at the next example.

05:28.580 --> 05:34.510
In this case A is 1 and 2 and B is also 1 and 2.

05:34.790 --> 05:38.850
So the union will be one and two.

05:39.080 --> 05:47.840
You can guess the result in this case where a contains 1 to free and B contains 4 and 5.

05:47.870 --> 05:52.970
The union of A and B will be 1 2 3 4 5.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.770
I hope that makes sense.

05:54.770 --> 05:59.690
Let's take a look at basic properties of this operation.

05:59.720 --> 06:04.770
I believe that if you really think about it you can figure it out.

06:05.180 --> 06:11.130
So what is the relation between A union B and B Union J.

06:12.050 --> 06:16.640
Well we have set containing all the elements from a.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.370
And also all the elements from B.

06:19.700 --> 06:27.150
And then we have other set containing all the elements from B and then also all the elements from a.

06:27.440 --> 06:33.490
And you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out these two sets are the same right.

06:34.010 --> 06:34.700
OK.

06:34.790 --> 06:40.450
Next one might not be so obvious but it also makes sense.

06:40.610 --> 06:49.120
A united with a B union C is also the same as a union B United.

06:49.130 --> 06:51.920
With c why.

06:52.160 --> 07:00.080
Well if you think about it here we are not a with the sad that is containing all the elements from B

07:00.200 --> 07:01.370
and C.

07:01.880 --> 07:09.630
And here we are and I said that it's containing all of the elements from a and b with set C..

07:09.830 --> 07:17.910
So in both example the final set will contain all the elements from a b and c.

07:17.930 --> 07:18.720
Right.

07:19.130 --> 07:19.800
OK.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.400
Another interesting fact is that a union a is equal to A.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.130
Right.

07:26.450 --> 07:31.870
Because this set is containing all the elements from a kind of twice.

07:31.890 --> 07:38.870
But since we don't care about how many times element is set it is the same as a.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.130
And I think that has enough properties.

07:42.140 --> 07:51.170
So let's take a look at intersection and what this basically does well it takes only the elements that

07:51.170 --> 07:53.570
are in both sets.

07:53.570 --> 07:59.350
We use this kind you upside down to describe this operation.

07:59.540 --> 08:02.700
And let me show you a few examples.

08:02.900 --> 08:14.990
If a contains 1 and 2 and B contains 2 and free the intersection of A and B will be set containing 2

08:15.950 --> 08:22.040
because 2 is the only element that is in a but also in B.

08:22.100 --> 08:30.230
So you can imagine this as if you have two boxes and you are taking only the elements that are in both

08:30.560 --> 08:32.060
boxes.

08:32.060 --> 08:41.750
Here is another example where a contains 1 and 2 and B contains want and to the intersection of A and

08:41.780 --> 08:47.020
B Wirz out into set containing 1 and 2.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.550
Because we have 1 in a.

08:49.820 --> 09:03.500
But also in B and we have two and they but also in B and in the example A contains 1 2 and 3 and B contains

09:03.500 --> 09:15.970
4 and 5 and the intersection of A and B is empty set because there is no element that is an A and B.

09:15.980 --> 09:17.520
I hope this makes sense.

09:17.660 --> 09:18.940
I think it does.

09:18.940 --> 09:24.860
So let's take a look at some basic properties of this operation.

09:24.860 --> 09:32.450
First one says that intersection of A and B is the same as intersection of B and they and this makes

09:32.450 --> 09:34.040
sense right.

09:34.040 --> 09:43.770
Second one says that a intersected with B intersection C is the same as a intersection B intersected

09:43.790 --> 09:45.140
with C.

09:45.200 --> 09:51.390
So if you think about it both of these statements will result in two said.

09:51.620 --> 10:01.810
And in this set will be only elements that are in a b and c there are more properties but you can figure

10:01.810 --> 10:10.030
out all of this if you really think about it so the next property says that a intersection a is equal

10:10.030 --> 10:10.760
to.

10:11.230 --> 10:20.500
And this one also makes sense because you have the elements that are in both sets and the sets are equal.

10:20.500 --> 10:26.060
That means the result will be also equal to a last operation.

10:26.070 --> 10:33.960
I will talk about in this lecture as councilman's this operation kind of represents subtraction with

10:33.960 --> 10:34.830
sets.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.860
And what I mean by that.

10:37.050 --> 10:44.400
Well a complement B is basically a without the elements that are in B.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.920
This might be confusing but it is actually pretty simple.

10:49.350 --> 10:58.230
If I have here set a containing 1 and 2 and then I have your set B containing 2 and 3.

10:58.290 --> 11:07.230
The complement is described by this and turned divide sine and the result is set that contains ments

11:07.290 --> 11:10.670
from a that are not in B.

11:10.860 --> 11:13.530
So you can think of it two ways.

11:13.530 --> 11:17.420
First one is that you are picking every element from a.

11:17.730 --> 11:26.040
And you are looking whether it is all I meant is also and B if it is you Frodo's alignment way if it

11:26.040 --> 11:26.860
is not.

11:26.970 --> 11:29.090
You add it into a result.

11:29.370 --> 11:35.850
So the result of compliments of a and b is set containing 1.

11:35.880 --> 11:36.540
Why.

11:36.750 --> 11:39.280
Well one is not in B.

11:39.420 --> 11:46.140
So we added to the result then we grab two and find out that two is in B.

11:46.140 --> 11:50.040
So if we're going away I hope that makes sense.

11:50.190 --> 11:57.810
And next example a contains 1 and 2 and B contains 1 and 2.

11:58.050 --> 12:02.560
So the result of complement of a and b is empty set.

12:02.580 --> 12:03.390
Why.

12:03.450 --> 12:06.800
Because every element from May is also in B.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.970
From this you can kind of figure out one property of compliment.

12:11.190 --> 12:17.890
If A is a subset of B then complement of A and B is empty set.

12:18.120 --> 12:22.680
And if you think about it a little bit it should make sense.

12:22.690 --> 12:32.110
Let's take a look at last example where a contains 1 2 and 3 and B contains four and five.

12:32.460 --> 12:36.640
Then the complement of A and B will be a.

12:36.870 --> 12:41.100
That means set containing 1 2 and 3.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.140
Why.

12:42.150 --> 12:47.010
Because B is not containing any element for A-MEI.

12:47.010 --> 12:51.990
Now let's take a look at some basic properties of complements.

12:51.990 --> 12:58.480
First one is that complement of A and B is not the same as complement of B.

12:58.560 --> 13:05.760
And they the only case where the result of these are the same is when A is equal to B.

13:05.760 --> 13:13.780
For example try this with a containing 1 2 3 and 4 and B containing 1 and 2.

13:14.180 --> 13:20.420
Also not a property is that good implemented of day and day is empty set.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.930
This also makes sense right.

13:23.490 --> 13:25.850
OK that's all there is to it.

13:25.950 --> 13:30.070
If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me.

13:30.090 --> 13:31.430
I'm here to help.

13:31.530 --> 13:33.610
And I will see you next time.
