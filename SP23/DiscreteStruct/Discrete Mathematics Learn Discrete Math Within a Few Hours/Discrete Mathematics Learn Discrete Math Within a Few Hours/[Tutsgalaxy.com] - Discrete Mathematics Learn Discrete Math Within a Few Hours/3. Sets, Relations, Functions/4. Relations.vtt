Hi guys and this lecture I will talk about relations over some said relation means that two elements

00:09.700 --> 00:12.450
are in some relation to each other.

00:12.490 --> 00:18.470
For example free is in the relation smaller than with five.

00:18.550 --> 00:22.650
I am in the relation of being son with my dad.

00:22.930 --> 00:31.000
I hope that makes sense and I think it does because we are in touch with all kinds of relations all

00:31.000 --> 00:32.300
the time.

00:32.340 --> 00:43.020
Now let's talk more about relations in mathematic terms relation on set A is some subset of a times.

00:43.510 --> 00:48.400
So now let's define what a times a means.

00:48.400 --> 00:57.670
In general we can multiply two different sets so let's say we want to multiply A and B and the result

00:57.930 --> 01:05.550
is also said that it's containing pairs where the first part is from set A.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.960
And the second part is from said be like this.

01:10.150 --> 01:22.540
So for example if a contains A B C and B contains 0 and 1 a times b where is out into set containing

01:22.570 --> 01:32.810
bears a and zero A and one B and zero B and one see ends zero and C and 1.

01:33.010 --> 01:40.660
So if you want to calculate something like this you can just pick one element from a and then put him

01:40.660 --> 01:48.080
together with all the elements from B and then you move to next element and.

01:48.370 --> 01:51.920
And when you reach the end you are done.

01:51.970 --> 01:59.860
So to get back to our example let's say that a contains number 1 2 and 2 free.

01:59.890 --> 02:03.020
So we compute a times a.

02:03.270 --> 02:07.180
The result of this operation looks like this.

02:07.180 --> 02:16.430
And now we can create the relation over array and we can do that by picking berries from this set.

02:16.630 --> 02:25.930
So for example if I have a relation that is defined for example like X minus XY is smaller or equal

02:25.930 --> 02:33.570
to zero Overbay it will contain beris from set A times a.

02:33.640 --> 02:45.590
So this relation will contain pairs 1 and 1 1 and 2 1 and 3 because 1 minus 1 is zero.

02:45.730 --> 02:49.470
And we want the result to be smaller or equal to zero.

02:49.600 --> 02:54.270
So that is correct 1 and 2 because one might assume is minus one.

02:54.430 --> 02:57.620
And same with one and free back.

02:57.880 --> 03:06.280
And this relation will not be two and one because two minus one will give us one and that is bigger

03:06.280 --> 03:15.880
than zero but there will be pair containing 2 and 2 2 and free and free and free.

03:15.880 --> 03:23.210
So these are all the pairs from set A that are in relation are.

03:23.380 --> 03:26.800
Sometimes people write this fact like this.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.250
So for example two are two.

03:30.340 --> 03:39.270
That means two is in relation are with two or they write are inside parentheses two and 2.

03:39.370 --> 03:41.510
That means the same thing.

03:41.510 --> 03:43.200
Now you might ask.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.030
And what is it good for.

03:46.030 --> 03:49.750
Well you probably know how data base looks like that.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.130
They didn't know that.

03:51.250 --> 03:55.410
We have something called relational database model.

03:55.570 --> 04:02.190
And in this model rows in database are elements of some relation.

04:02.230 --> 04:11.210
So now I showed you example of something called binary relation and this means there are two elements.

04:11.230 --> 04:13.280
And during this relation.

04:13.570 --> 04:17.860
So it is a relation between x and y.

04:18.040 --> 04:23.880
But we can have a relation between and elements where n is some natural number.

04:23.980 --> 04:32.100
That way we are picking elements from a time say times a times a where a is there and times.

04:32.110 --> 04:42.150
So for example if this free relation R can look like X is smaller than I and II is greater than z that

04:42.150 --> 04:52.800
is just one of many examples and this relation will contain 1 2 1 1 3 1 2 free 2.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.010
I hope you understand it.

04:55.190 --> 05:00.560
Now let's talk about properties of binary relations.

05:00.660 --> 05:06.170
So first property is reflexivity and what that means.

05:06.190 --> 05:15.750
Well if we have a relation overlay this relation is reflexive when every element for May is in the relation

05:15.990 --> 05:18.040
with itself.

05:18.060 --> 05:27.930
So if you take a look at our first example it is reflexive because one is in relation with one two is

05:27.940 --> 05:34.320
in relation with two and three is a new relation with free.

05:34.350 --> 05:35.790
I hope that makes sense.

05:35.910 --> 05:40.510
Every element from a MUST be in relation with itself.

05:41.130 --> 05:43.510
Next property is symmetry.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.900
And what that means.

05:46.140 --> 05:54.890
Well in general if x and y is in relation I and X must also be in relation.

05:54.930 --> 06:00.230
So if we look at our relation it is obviously not symmetric.

06:00.330 --> 06:07.100
For example 1 and 3 is in relation dot free and Dujuan is not.

06:07.110 --> 06:18.100
So in order for a relation to be symmetric there must be a kind of opposite pairs next one is antisymmetry.

06:18.300 --> 06:27.810
And what that means when some mix and is in the relation and I and x is in the relation also then x

06:27.930 --> 06:37.770
is equal to II and if we look at this relation it is anti-symmetric because the only pairs that are

06:37.770 --> 06:50.740
symmetric are 1 and 1 2 and 2 and free and free y let's say that x and y is 1 and 1 then we need to

06:50.740 --> 07:00.940
find in this relation I and X but since I and X are equal we are trying to find one and one and one

07:00.940 --> 07:03.900
and one is obviously in this relation.

07:03.940 --> 07:12.480
Similarly with our bears and for all of these pairs it's also true that X is equal to II.

07:12.730 --> 07:17.830
So that means this relation is anti-symmetric OK.

07:18.000 --> 07:27.230
Let's look at last Twan transitivity relation is transitive when for every x and y and z from a.

07:27.420 --> 07:39.710
It's true that if x and y is in relation and I and Z is in the relation then x and z is also in relation.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.980
So once again let's take a look at our example.

07:43.140 --> 07:44.300
It is transitive.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.050
I am sure you're not seeing it right away.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.530
And that is OK.

07:48.540 --> 07:52.490
This takes practice like anything bad.

07:52.490 --> 07:58.450
If I show you example if I pick one and two as a x and die.

07:58.470 --> 08:02.840
Now I am looking for some bear that starts with two.

08:03.000 --> 08:12.700
So I can for example pick two and three and then I need to find one and three in this relation since

08:12.720 --> 08:21.130
one is our X and free is our z and I am able to find one and free in this relation.

08:21.340 --> 08:24.340
But this must be true for every pair.

08:24.390 --> 08:28.330
So you can try to check the rest on your own.

08:28.560 --> 08:34.970
And with that being said if you have any questions just ask and I will see you next time.
