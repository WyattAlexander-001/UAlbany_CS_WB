In this grade math function composition is the pointwise application of function to the result of another

00:11.290 --> 00:11.830
one.

00:11.860 --> 00:23.680
For instance if I have function f that takes value from set x and returns a value from I and I also

00:23.680 --> 00:30.460
have a function g that takes value from I and returns value from Z.

00:30.760 --> 00:38.410
And now I can do composition of these two and it looks like this.

00:38.410 --> 00:40.920
So first we have g.

00:41.080 --> 00:49.600
Then there is the circle and then a function f and this G circle f basically means this.

00:49.630 --> 00:56.140
So f grab some X and returns us some.

00:56.680 --> 01:04.960
And then function g tags D I that f returned and turns it into z.

01:05.020 --> 01:11.010
So this position is basically a function from x to z.

01:11.050 --> 01:11.630
Right.

01:12.620 --> 01:23.770
Think of it this way you graph some x and you first base it into f eth does some computing and pass

01:23.790 --> 01:25.340
is the result.

01:25.350 --> 01:31.770
A.G. And finally G returns as the final result.

01:31.850 --> 01:34.400
Bob it is not so easy.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.120
There can be a problem.

01:36.300 --> 01:41.950
We must accept everything that returns.

01:41.970 --> 01:51.300
So in this case it works because APH returns some element from set by and we take some element from

01:51.310 --> 01:52.250
set.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.320
But you need to keep this in mind.

01:56.430 --> 01:59.950
So let's take a look at some examples.

02:00.090 --> 02:10.020
So I have here a function f that takes some natural number and returns a natural number and it is defined

02:10.320 --> 02:15.000
as is equal to x times 2.

02:15.240 --> 02:24.960
And then I have a function g that takes some natural number and address turns some integer number and

02:25.080 --> 02:27.100
it is the find as I.

02:27.330 --> 02:30.020
Is equal to x minus 2.

02:30.240 --> 02:35.970
So let's see how composition of these two looks like.

02:36.000 --> 02:46.590
So for example when I call this with free I will pass free to f f will return free times to.

02:46.740 --> 02:49.760
Because I is X times 2.

02:49.950 --> 02:57.250
So that is 6 and then I pass the 6 into G and what G does.

02:57.450 --> 03:02.820
Well it just subtract 2 from the value that you have passed.

03:03.090 --> 03:06.730
So the final result will be 4.

03:07.140 --> 03:10.700
Let's try it again with 5.

03:10.750 --> 03:15.840
I pass 5 into f f will return.

03:16.060 --> 03:19.510
Then g is whatever f returned.

03:19.560 --> 03:27.390
In this case it is then subtract 2 from it and return the final result.

03:27.390 --> 03:29.100
In this case a.

03:29.490 --> 03:30.860
I hope this makes sense.

03:31.020 --> 03:34.720
Let's take a look at another example in here.

03:34.770 --> 03:44.370
I get asked that takes some natural number and returns us some rational number and it is defined as

03:45.050 --> 03:55.470
is equal to 2 divided by x then I have function g that takes some natural number and returns as other

03:55.620 --> 04:07.320
natural number and it is defined as is equal to 2 times X minus 1 and I want to do composition of these

04:07.320 --> 04:08.180
two.

04:08.190 --> 04:10.690
So let's try the same thing.

04:10.920 --> 04:14.760
Let's go this composition with one.

04:14.940 --> 04:25.010
So I grab one pass it into f f returns us two divided by 1 and that is just two right.

04:25.260 --> 04:37.210
So g grabs this number and returns us two times to minus 1 and that is free and that is the final result.

04:37.350 --> 04:43.560
But maybe try this with free we pass free into f.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.890
Returns us two thirds.

04:45.980 --> 04:48.840
Bob here comes the problem.

04:48.840 --> 04:58.320
G accepts only natural numbers and as you should already know two thirds is not a natural number.

04:58.410 --> 04:59.910
It is rational number.

05:00.030 --> 05:11.220
So that is why you cannot compose these two functions because G cannot handle two thirds as a input.

05:11.220 --> 05:14.580
I hope this makes sense and I think it does so.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.250
That is pretty much it for this lecture.

05:17.250 --> 05:21.720
If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will see you next time.
