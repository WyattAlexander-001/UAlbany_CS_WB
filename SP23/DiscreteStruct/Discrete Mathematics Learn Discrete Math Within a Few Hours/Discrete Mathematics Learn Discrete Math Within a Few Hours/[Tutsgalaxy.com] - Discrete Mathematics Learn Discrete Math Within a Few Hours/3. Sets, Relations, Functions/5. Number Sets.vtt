00:01.050 --> 00:09.780
So now you already know what's said is that there they're Kapleau of numeric SATs that we can use and

00:09.840 --> 00:14.530
we use these sets a lot for example with functions.

00:14.790 --> 00:17.220
So let's take a look at them.

00:17.280 --> 00:20.130
First one is called natural numbers.

00:20.130 --> 00:25.430
It is defined as this and and it contains numbers like 1 2 3.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.930
And so one to infinity.

00:27.930 --> 00:30.910
So an doesn't contain zero.

00:30.930 --> 00:36.280
It doesn't contain minus 1 it doesn't contain 3.5.

00:36.300 --> 00:45.900
I just said I want to talk about is the set of real numbers and this said containing every number you

00:45.900 --> 00:47.250
can think of.

00:47.340 --> 00:58.170
So every number in this world like zero minus 50 Try free point five ONE-THIRD.

00:58.410 --> 01:07.820
So every number from minus infinity to infinity next sad is the set of rational numbers.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.560
It is defined as this.

01:09.580 --> 01:20.290
Q And this set is containing all the numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two integer values.

01:20.310 --> 01:27.160
So for example 1 divided by free or minus three divided by five.

01:27.240 --> 01:37.890
But for example plie won't be here because it is irrational number or not a set is the set of integers.

01:37.890 --> 01:41.720
It is defined as Z and what it contains.

01:41.760 --> 01:49.750
Well it contains whole numbers so numbers that can be written without fractional component.

01:49.920 --> 02:00.630
So for example forty one zero minus five thousand are all integers about five point twenty five is not

02:01.260 --> 02:04.680
minus two divided by three is also not.

02:05.100 --> 02:13.880
So this is a set of numbers without decimal point from minus infinity to infinity.

02:13.920 --> 02:21.090
So these are the main numeric sets we will use these later on in this Kerr's.
