00:00.180 --> 00:01.770
So what is graph.

00:01.950 --> 00:10.200
Yeah I guess this is graph that I meant in this green mathematics graph is something that is made up

00:10.200 --> 00:20.640
from Agis and notes mostly you can see this notation where node is represented by a circle and inside

00:20.640 --> 00:25.350
that circle can be some ID for example one or a.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.150
And then there are agist.

00:28.260 --> 00:34.160
And these are just lines connecting exactly two nodes like this.

00:34.290 --> 00:38.080
So for example this cannot happen.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.330
You cannot connect freen nodes.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.760
Why a one match.

00:41.970 --> 00:43.670
And this also cannot happen.

00:43.670 --> 00:47.910
You can just when from one note to nowhere.

00:47.910 --> 00:52.540
Also etch can be oriented or honor oriented.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.080
And what that means.

00:54.270 --> 01:00.950
Well for example this is oriented at connecting notes say and B.

01:00.990 --> 01:10.560
And since this Agis oriented you can get from May to be but also from B to say but on the other hand

01:10.560 --> 01:14.280
when I have oriented graph it can look like this.

01:14.520 --> 01:21.570
And notice that there is not just a line connecting a and b but there is a narrow.

01:21.690 --> 01:29.750
So in this graph you can get from May to be bad you cannot get from B to AA.

01:29.880 --> 01:34.360
So let's take a look at more interesting example.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.140
This graph is oriented and it contains.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.640
Note A B C D.

01:41.130 --> 01:47.310
And the first thing you may notice is that there is no act leading to.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.230
And that is all right.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.700
There is nothing wrong with that.

01:51.750 --> 01:58.850
Imagine that this graph represents a real world network and he is an island.

01:58.860 --> 02:06.630
Another thing you may notice is that there are more Agis and think in C and that is also OK.

02:06.750 --> 02:10.800
There can be more rotes ending in one city right.

02:10.860 --> 02:18.400
So now I want you to pause the video and find the path from A to D.

02:18.450 --> 02:26.250
So since there is not direct damage from A to D there is Zetsche from the 2A but we cannot use that

02:26.310 --> 02:28.670
because it is graphics oriented.

02:28.950 --> 02:35.950
So we have to go from A to C and then we have to go from C to D.

02:35.970 --> 02:40.000
So the path from May to the looks like this.

02:40.020 --> 02:47.660
Now if I change this graph to an oriented graph you can just use this at from A to Z.

02:47.730 --> 02:51.000
So that is pretty much how graph works.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.880
Now let's take a look at more mathematic definition.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.640
Graph is defined as.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.840
To sum.

02:58.020 --> 03:05.260
First we have a set of nodes and then we have saddo vacuous we means Verd to cease.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.610
But I like no more.

03:07.770 --> 03:12.060
So I am using node bad where just the CNO is the same thing.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.000
And this we sat cannot be empty.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.580
So there has to be at least one note than this.

03:19.590 --> 03:24.670
He means Agis and it is a subset of we.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.970
SIMES we.

03:26.250 --> 03:35.720
And that makes sense is basically a relation over we because two notes either are in relation.

03:35.940 --> 03:40.040
In other words they are connected or they are not.

03:40.110 --> 03:42.960
So they are not in relation.

03:42.960 --> 03:49.830
And when the graph is Sun oriented It doesn't matter in what order the notes and Edge are.

03:49.830 --> 03:54.650
If there is say and the it is the same as if there were BNA.

03:54.870 --> 04:03.640
But when a graph is oriented the order matters so and B is different that then B anyway.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.530
I think this is pretty clear.

04:05.730 --> 04:11.070
Let's take a look at more real world application of graphs.

04:11.070 --> 04:16.730
Imagine that this honor oriented graph represents a road network.

04:16.830 --> 04:25.800
But this time we have numbers next to Agis and this value can represent for example the length or how

04:25.800 --> 04:27.390
much time it took.

04:27.390 --> 04:36.900
So for example if I want to get from A to B I can go there directly and get a result value of 10 or

04:37.200 --> 04:42.200
I can go through the and get the result value of 6.

04:42.210 --> 04:48.350
So then the problem is how to decide what path you should take.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.500
And that is a topic for following lecture.

04:52.510 --> 04:55.080
So yeah it does somethings up.

04:55.080 --> 05:05.530
Graphs are made up from notes and edges atch is connect exactly two notes graph can be oriented or oriented

05:06.100 --> 05:12.910
and also edges can have values and that is pretty much it for this lecture.

05:12.910 --> 05:17.320
If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will see you next time.
