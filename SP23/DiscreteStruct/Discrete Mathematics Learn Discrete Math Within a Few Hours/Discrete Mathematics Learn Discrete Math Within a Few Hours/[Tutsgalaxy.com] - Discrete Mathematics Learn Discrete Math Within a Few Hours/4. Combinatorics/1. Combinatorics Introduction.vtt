Combinatorics is one of the most important part of discrete mathematic combinatorics answer answers

00:07.770 --> 00:12.250
the question How many possibilities there is.

00:12.360 --> 00:20.100
So it should not surprise you that combinatorics have usage in many practical parts of our lives.

00:20.310 --> 00:29.990
For example many people don't know that bad combinatorics is where it connected with security of computers.

00:30.060 --> 00:36.600
For example when decrypting and encrypting data we use combinatorics.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.410
So let's get started.

00:38.430 --> 00:44.150
First thing I want to talk about is the ad rule and what that means.

00:44.360 --> 00:54.180
Well if we want to compute possibilities of something that have or in it we use this for example if

00:54.180 --> 01:02.470
I want to know how many possibilities do I have when I want to pick one element from a or b.

01:02.580 --> 01:07.250
So since I have four elements I have four possibilities.

01:07.500 --> 01:13.920
And since B have free elements I have additional free possibilities.

01:13.920 --> 01:18.020
So the solution is for plus free.

01:18.150 --> 01:19.940
So the result is seven.

01:19.950 --> 01:21.790
I hope this makes sense.

01:21.810 --> 01:28.830
Second row is the multiplication rule and that takes place when we need to do that.

01:28.890 --> 01:35.320
C and this task can be split into Task A and B.

01:35.640 --> 01:39.350
And if we can do a away.

01:39.840 --> 01:47.130
And if we can do B and the ways we can do C and times and ways.

01:47.160 --> 01:53.850
So let me show you an example if I have free t shirts and for trousers.

01:53.850 --> 01:56.770
How many unique outfits can I have.

01:57.690 --> 02:00.540
The answer is free times four.

02:00.810 --> 02:01.810
And that is 12.

02:01.830 --> 02:06.610
But I want you to also think about why is a 12.

02:06.900 --> 02:12.810
Well if I take one of these free T-shirts I have four possible trousers.

02:12.990 --> 02:23.430
So that is floor options then if I take the second T-shirt I have another four options and with 30 shirt

02:23.730 --> 02:25.820
I have last four options.

02:25.950 --> 02:27.980
And that gives me 12.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.860
I hope you understand this.

02:29.880 --> 02:36.080
So now let's take a look at a more advanced example that combines these concepts.

02:36.120 --> 02:46.410
So imagine that dummy in restaurant and this restaurant has three main foods seven drinks and two desserts.

02:46.740 --> 02:53.540
And I won one main food and one drink or dessert but not both.

02:53.580 --> 02:56.080
How many options do I have.

02:56.430 --> 03:03.330
Well my dinner can be split it into main food and drink or dessert.

03:03.330 --> 03:08.100
So I will have three times one drink or dessert.

03:08.400 --> 03:16.040
And as you can see we have or in this sentence so there should be seven plus two.

03:16.050 --> 03:21.750
So the result is free time snide and that is just 27.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.710
I hope this makes sense and that is pretty much it for this lecture.

03:26.850 --> 03:30.020
If they have any problems feel free to contact me.

03:30.090 --> 03:31.310
I will see you next time.
