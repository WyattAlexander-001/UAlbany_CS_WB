00:00.360 --> 00:08.700
Combinations are pretty much the same as permutations or variations but in combinations we don't care

00:08.790 --> 00:14.230
about the order in peregrinations we cared about the order of events.

00:14.490 --> 00:23.020
So to make things absolutely clear permutation A and B is different than permutation B.

00:23.190 --> 00:30.900
And they that combination A and B is the same a combination of B and day.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.050
So let me show you an example.

00:34.050 --> 00:44.400
Imagine that I have set A that is containing numbers 1 2 and 3 and I want all subsets that have two

00:44.610 --> 00:46.090
elements.

00:46.110 --> 00:47.570
This is pretty simple.

00:47.580 --> 00:54.120
It is actually one and two and two and three and then one and three.

00:54.180 --> 01:01.890
But now I want to demonstrate the difference between combinations and permutation and permutation.

01:01.950 --> 01:11.100
It would be A and B and C than B and day b and c and then CNA and cn b.

01:11.340 --> 01:19.140
And since the formula for combinations is not so easy to come up with I will show you the formula right

01:19.140 --> 01:19.660
now.

01:19.860 --> 01:21.800
So that is it.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.310
Now I will at least tell you what that means.

01:26.310 --> 01:36.900
So since we are picking our elements from an we can compute this and factory are divided by and minus

01:36.960 --> 01:38.310
our factory.

01:38.550 --> 01:39.200
Why.

01:39.420 --> 01:43.440
Well that is basically K permutation over n right.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.330
It is the same formula.

01:45.330 --> 01:54.990
But this time we also need to get rid of all the cases where the only difference is in-order and we

01:54.990 --> 02:03.870
will do that by multiplying the down part or fraction with our factorial and actually let me show you

02:03.870 --> 02:06.150
that it works on these examples.

02:06.360 --> 02:12.290
So the number of false subsets that have two elements is free.

02:12.300 --> 02:12.960
Right.

02:13.060 --> 02:15.720
Let's see what this formula gives us.

02:15.720 --> 02:25.110
So in our case an is equal to free because we have free elements in set A and R will be two because

02:25.170 --> 02:27.900
we are picking two numbers.

02:27.900 --> 02:37.770
Now we have all we need to compute this formula on top will be factory all all free and we will divide

02:37.770 --> 02:42.990
that by factorial of and minus R and that is 1.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.920
And then multiply by factorial of are.

02:46.950 --> 02:57.980
So factory 2 now factorial free is 6 because free time sometimes 1 is 6 factorial of one as well.

02:58.170 --> 03:00.700
And factoring of 2 is 2.

03:00.780 --> 03:05.360
So we get six divided by two and that is free.

03:05.370 --> 03:10.250
You might also see this notation and choose k.

03:10.290 --> 03:16.980
So for example in our case it would be free choose to and it is free.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.100
Let's look at another example.

03:19.170 --> 03:28.080
Imagine that you have a group of ten boys and five girls and you want to choose two girls and one boy.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.890
How many options do you have when you don't care about the order.

03:33.030 --> 03:37.680
You can once again pause the video and try to do this on your own.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.420
So let's split it into two task.

03:41.460 --> 03:44.090
First one is pick two girls.

03:44.220 --> 03:47.070
And second is big boy.

03:47.340 --> 03:51.250
So we need to pick two girls from five.

03:51.390 --> 03:55.500
So in first round we are picking from five girls.

03:55.560 --> 03:59.760
Then when we are picking second girl we have four options.

03:59.790 --> 04:09.480
So five times four gives us 20 but now we need to get the rate of all the permutations that are different

04:09.570 --> 04:17.390
only in order and we will do that by dividing that 20 by our factory.

04:17.610 --> 04:20.900
So that has to factor here and that is true.

04:21.030 --> 04:22.750
So the result will be.

04:22.780 --> 04:30.400
Then you have 10 options how to pick two girls from five when you don't care about the order.

04:30.510 --> 04:35.290
Now the second problem is to pick one boy from 10.

04:35.370 --> 04:38.280
And obviously you have 10 options right.

04:38.280 --> 04:46.760
So now since these were subproblems we multiply the results and get the final result.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.040
And that is a hundred.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.930
I hope this makes sense.

04:50.940 --> 04:54.760
So let's move on to combinations with repetition.

04:54.930 --> 05:02.550
So we have been given and objects and we want to select our objects with replacements.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.900
So imagine that and is five.

05:06.060 --> 05:13.180
So we have item one item to all the way up to 5 and then our is free.

05:13.200 --> 05:23.060
So we are picking free elements but this time when we are picking men we will put it back into the set.

05:23.070 --> 05:32.930
So if I pick free as a first element I will cross it right here and then I add it to the end.

05:32.940 --> 05:35.510
Then I can pick for example one.

05:35.640 --> 05:42.330
So I will cross in here and add it to the end and then I can pick free again.

05:42.330 --> 05:48.600
So I will cross it in here and then I will add free again and I'm done.

05:48.600 --> 05:57.900
I have my free aliments So we are actually doing 7 choose free and you already know how to compute this

05:58.170 --> 06:01.280
so it will be 35.

06:01.290 --> 06:04.110
So let me show you an example.

06:04.380 --> 06:08.680
Imagine that we have this question x y.

06:08.760 --> 06:19.180
Plus X 2 plus X free plus x 4 is equal to 16 where all the exits are positive integer values.

06:19.470 --> 06:23.360
How many solutions to this equation exists.

06:23.370 --> 06:26.340
So what we are actually solving.

06:26.340 --> 06:35.730
Imagine that we have 16 balls and we trying to get them into four boxes that is actually what we are

06:35.730 --> 06:36.520
doing.

06:36.840 --> 06:46.140
Let's say that two goes into first two on six goes into second one it goes into third one and none goes

06:46.170 --> 06:47.630
into last one.

06:47.700 --> 06:53.790
And now imagine that instead of boxes there are X variables.

06:53.820 --> 06:58.880
So first says x 1 second this x 2 and so on.

06:59.130 --> 07:04.280
And if you compute that you will see that it is actually 16.

07:04.290 --> 07:14.950
So what we are actually doing we are dividing the 16 balls into four boxes but you can also think of

07:14.980 --> 07:18.020
that as separating these balls.

07:18.120 --> 07:18.780
Right.

07:18.810 --> 07:23.560
So the previous example can look like this.

07:23.570 --> 07:27.290
So this part represents first box.

07:27.290 --> 07:29.900
This part represents second box.

07:29.910 --> 07:36.010
This represents third box and this part represents fourth box.

07:36.120 --> 07:42.800
But now we need to find all the possible positions for our free separators.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.660
Right.

07:43.730 --> 07:52.280
So what we are actually doing we are picking free positions where to put our separators and all the

07:52.280 --> 07:56.460
separators can for example be in front of all these balls.

07:56.510 --> 08:03.540
That would mean x 1 0 x 2 0 x free 0 and x 4 is 16.

08:03.590 --> 08:10.280
So we are actually kind of picking three elements from 16 plus free.

08:10.350 --> 08:11.130
Right.

08:11.300 --> 08:16.880
And we don't care about the order all the elements can be the same.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.730
So the result of this would be 18 choose free.

08:22.010 --> 08:25.540
And that should be eight hundred and sixteen.

08:25.580 --> 08:33.140
So you might notice that we use this formula and a plus or minus one to choose are.

08:33.140 --> 08:41.380
So if I get back to for example we had five items and we were choosing free.

08:41.540 --> 08:48.590
So five plus free minus 1 will be 7 and R is free.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.330
And that is exactly what we got.

08:51.440 --> 08:55.590
So yeah this thing is maybe a bit complicated.

08:55.610 --> 08:59.000
It might take some time for you to get used to it.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.490
So feel free to watch this video again.

09:02.510 --> 09:04.090
There is no shame in that.

09:04.130 --> 09:06.240
And I will see you next time.
