00:00.560 --> 00:04.460
Variation also means gay permutation Nover N..

00:04.640 --> 00:06.390
And what that means.

00:06.410 --> 00:15.990
Well imagine that you are a teacher and you are taking four students for exam and all class for teachers

00:16.030 --> 00:24.920
students and also for some reason you care in what order your students go.

00:24.920 --> 00:32.560
So for example Adam Bob David and Mike is not the same as Bob.

00:32.660 --> 00:43.060
Adam David and Mike these are two different lineups than K is equal to four and is 42.

00:43.310 --> 00:49.380
And number of option is defined as a k permutation over.

00:49.400 --> 00:56.570
So before I show you the formula that is used to compute this I want to show you how you can figure

00:56.570 --> 00:57.510
it out.

00:57.530 --> 01:02.770
So when you are picking first students you have 42 option.

01:02.930 --> 01:11.570
So let's right 42 than you need to pick another one and you have 41 options then another one and you

01:11.570 --> 01:15.560
have 40 options and then you have thirty nine options.

01:15.830 --> 01:19.400
But then you stop because you have your four students.

01:19.460 --> 01:20.450
Right.

01:20.510 --> 01:27.820
So the result is 42 size 41 times 40 times 39.

01:28.070 --> 01:30.310
And I hope this kind of makes sense.

01:30.320 --> 01:40.400
So let me show you the formula for this variation of K overon is actually and times and mine is one

01:40.580 --> 01:46.050
times all the way up to and minus k plus 1.

01:46.220 --> 01:52.750
And if you think about it that is exactly what I wrote here and it's 42.

01:52.850 --> 01:59.840
And we want to get down to 39 and 39 is and minus gay plus 1.

02:00.170 --> 02:01.730
So it actually works.

02:01.940 --> 02:06.990
I think this should not be a problem for you when you understand permutation.

02:07.190 --> 02:12.980
So let's move on to variation with repetition and what that means.

02:13.160 --> 02:19.130
Well it is variation but you can pick same item multiple times.

02:19.130 --> 02:21.980
So let's take a look at example.

02:22.310 --> 02:32.020
Imagine that you have an logical statements how many possible ratings can these statements have.

02:32.060 --> 02:38.640
You should know that already but I will say that anyway every expression can be true or false.

02:38.750 --> 02:47.580
So we have two options for every expression and there can be more than one expression that is true.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.130
And same goes with balls.

02:50.330 --> 02:56.620
So let's say that we have one statement we get two possible outcomes.

02:56.630 --> 02:58.970
It can be either true or false.

02:59.150 --> 03:07.330
That should make sense but when we have another statement we multiply it by two.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.060
Why.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.760
Well as mentioned before it could be true or false.

03:12.770 --> 03:19.570
So we kind of grab all the possibilities before and we get to the end zero.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.570
And then we get to the end.

03:21.670 --> 03:26.260
One it might sound confusing so let me show you.

03:26.260 --> 03:38.000
Example if I add the second expression the values that get the statement that are 0 0 0 1 1 0 and 1

03:38.120 --> 03:38.760
1.

03:39.020 --> 03:46.800
So in this example I took all the possible outcomes of first statement that is 1 and 0.

03:46.970 --> 03:50.710
And then I added it in front of those zero.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.480
That way I got these two statements.

03:53.630 --> 03:57.000
And then I added in front of these two one.

03:57.020 --> 04:02.150
So I got these two additional ratings and all of that is the result.

04:02.330 --> 04:08.470
All of these are possible ratings for two statements with free statements.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.410
There should be a Dobsons.

04:10.590 --> 04:13.190
But back to our example.

04:13.220 --> 04:20.820
So with each statements we are multiplying current result by 2 right.

04:20.870 --> 04:26.630
So the obvious result is two to the power of Anna.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.340
Right.

04:27.650 --> 04:35.670
The thing that can confuse you is that this time our An example was actually K in the formula.

04:35.690 --> 04:39.050
These are variations with repeating.

04:39.050 --> 04:43.570
If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will see you next time.
