00:00.360 --> 00:03.670
OK let's look at something more interesting.

00:03.720 --> 00:13.150
Let's look at permutation permutation of an object means how many unique lineups can I get.

00:13.290 --> 00:20.430
So for example imagine that you have four friends in your support team and you are the captain.

00:20.670 --> 00:27.090
So now you need to decide in what order your friends will go.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.790
For example running or something like that.

00:29.820 --> 00:33.620
So how many possible lines up do you have.

00:33.900 --> 00:42.250
Well if we try to solve this kind of logically and first round you can choose one of your four friends.

00:42.270 --> 00:43.390
Right.

00:43.470 --> 00:49.900
So let's write for then in the second round you are choosing one.

00:50.100 --> 00:56.810
But only for free remaining friends because one of them ran in the first round.

00:56.850 --> 00:57.400
Right.

00:58.180 --> 01:00.910
So let's write free.

01:00.910 --> 01:03.870
Now you have only two options.

01:03.880 --> 01:04.480
Why.

01:04.690 --> 01:11.500
Well one of your friends run in first round and some other friend runs in second round.

01:11.620 --> 01:16.330
So you can pick only one of the two remaining friends.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.220
So let's try to.

01:18.400 --> 01:27.040
And lastly you have one friend remaining so let's write while now I believe you should see that between

01:27.040 --> 01:30.560
these numbers will be multiplication.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.290
Why.

01:31.480 --> 01:39.730
Well if you pick Bupp first then you have three possible options in second round and two in third round

01:40.060 --> 01:41.130
and so on.

01:41.190 --> 01:45.220
It is pretty much the same as with T-shirts and trousers.

01:45.340 --> 01:50.690
But now you are picking people and there are more rounds than two.

01:50.890 --> 01:52.600
I hope this makes sense.

01:52.600 --> 02:01.360
So now the result will be four times three times two times Swan And that is twenty four.

02:01.390 --> 02:09.910
But some of you might stop in here and see that this is actually factorial of four and you are right

02:10.300 --> 02:11.940
if you are one of those people.

02:11.980 --> 02:13.140
Good for you.

02:13.140 --> 02:16.460
But anyway it is factorial of four.

02:16.540 --> 02:21.650
For those of you who don't know what factorial is it looks like this.

02:21.700 --> 02:30.760
In general there can be an and factorial is defined by this exclamation mark but what it is in general

02:30.760 --> 02:39.190
factorial of then is and times and minus one times and minus two and all the way up to 1.

02:39.190 --> 02:49.150
So for example factory or six will be six times five times four times three times two times one and

02:49.150 --> 02:50.120
factorial.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.740
There's also the general result of permutation.

02:54.790 --> 03:02.310
So if you have permutation Northmen objects the result will be factorial of an.

03:02.590 --> 03:05.870
But I don't want you to use this formula.

03:05.930 --> 03:13.290
Why I want you to think about the problem when you use a formula and don't think about the problem.

03:13.330 --> 03:15.220
It is useless for you.

03:15.220 --> 03:23.220
But when you think about it and solve it by logical deduction you are kind of working gowd your brain.

03:23.260 --> 03:26.740
I know this sounds a bit funny but it is true.

03:27.190 --> 03:32.360
And you can also write it down like I did in the first example.

03:32.680 --> 03:39.000
So there's no shame in that but don't use this formula just because it works.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.110
So now let's look at second example.

03:42.310 --> 03:48.180
You can try to solve this one by yourself and then go back and check with me.

03:48.220 --> 03:50.060
So it goes like this.

03:50.080 --> 03:57.480
Imagine that you have a books about computer science and then you have five books about math.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.440
How many possible lines do you have.

04:00.580 --> 04:05.750
When he won the said books about computer science on left side of table.

04:05.890 --> 04:13.210
And these five books about math on the right side of table feel free to pause the video and try to solve

04:13.210 --> 04:13.650
it.

04:13.750 --> 04:18.250
And don't worry if he gets stuck I will be here to help you out.

04:18.250 --> 04:22.390
So let's start by splitting this task into two.

04:22.660 --> 04:31.720
How well we need to line up all the computer science books and we also need to line up all the math

04:31.720 --> 04:32.740
books.

04:32.800 --> 04:40.390
So one task is to align computer science book and second is to align math books.

04:40.390 --> 04:43.310
Let's start with computer science.

04:43.560 --> 04:47.430
There are a set of them and we need to line them up.

04:47.470 --> 04:51.760
So when we are baking first we have eight options right.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.540
And then when we are picking second one we have only seven options because we already picked one as

04:59.560 --> 05:07.210
first then we have six options because we already picked first and second and we cannot have one book

05:07.210 --> 05:08.230
on two places.

05:08.230 --> 05:08.890
Right.

05:09.280 --> 05:13.590
And this will go on and on until we get to one.

05:13.780 --> 05:17.800
So the result is factorial of fate.

05:17.860 --> 05:23.830
Let's look at the second task where we want to line up five math books.

05:23.830 --> 05:33.460
So when we pick first we have five choices then we are picking second and we have four books and so

05:33.460 --> 05:34.990
on until 1.

05:35.230 --> 05:40.690
So we solve the subtask first one is factorial.

05:40.700 --> 05:44.330
They and second one is factorials 5.

05:44.330 --> 05:48.970
Now let's think about what to do with these results.

05:49.090 --> 05:58.510
And I want to imagine this in the real world if you somehow line up your computer science Vuic you have

05:58.520 --> 06:04.020
factory authorized options how to line up your math books right.

06:04.770 --> 06:13.360
And then if you change the lineup of your computer science books you once again have factorials five

06:13.440 --> 06:16.740
options how to line up math books.

06:16.740 --> 06:25.810
So now you should figure out that for every line up of your computer science books you have factorial

06:25.860 --> 06:30.450
of five options how to align your math books.

06:30.450 --> 06:37.650
You also know that there is a factory all set of possible line ups of your computer science book.

06:37.710 --> 06:44.360
So the result will be factory of eight times factory or all five.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.560
And this will be really a big number.

06:47.580 --> 06:50.220
So yeah I hope this makes sense.

06:50.220 --> 06:53.270
That is kind of how you compute permutation.

06:53.400 --> 07:00.940
Remember in permutation you hath and items and you want to know how many line ups there is.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.010
OK.

07:02.250 --> 07:06.520
If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will see you next time.
